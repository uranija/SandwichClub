# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
**Sandwich Club** app that
shows the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Project's purpose
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers at work. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project helped
me to better understand how it is processed.

## What I learned
Through this project:
- I learned how to submit projects for review
- Practiced JSON parsing to a model object
- Designed an activity layout
- Populated all fields in the layout accordingly
